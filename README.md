# Room.js Component Updates

The `Room.js` component has been enhanced to include a more detailed calendar view. This update provides a comprehensive overview of room availability and bookings.

### New Features:
- **Detailed Calendar View**: The calendar now displays days of the week and time slots.
- **Color-Coded Slots**: Different colors are used to indicate available and booked slots, making it easy to see room availability at a glance.
- **Styling**: Added `Room.css` for improved styling of the room calendar view.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
